    <ol>
        <li>Accessibility. For students who are visually impaired, using a virtual machine can be very difficult.
        </li>
        <li>Not all students have a capable laptop. Sometimes due to financial reasons, some students use
            Chromebooks.
            The tools required for this course can be installed natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.</li>
        <li>Performance. Sometimes, using a VM can be very slow. A VM also do not use native drivers (e.g., for
            networking).</li>

    <h3>Q: Is Piazza used in this course?</h3>
    <p>In summer 2020, I returned to using Piazza again. In spring 2020, I decided not to use Piazza because (1) I felt it was a nuisance for students to use multiple websites and services for one course, and (2) at times, it was underutilized. However, I noticed a drop-off in the discussions, and the Discussions interface on Canvas isn't as nice as Piazza's. Also, students can chime in anonymously on Piazza but not on Canvas. Finally, because most Computer Science courses use Piazza, it has been an expectation for students. Thus, I brought it back.</p>
    <h3>Q: Why is there a course website and a course Canvas? If you say "it is a nuisance for students to use multiple websites and services for one course", what gives?</h3>
    <p>This course website serves a few critical purposes. Years ago, I made a decision to make all the readings, slide decks, and most of the labs publicly available. The reasons: (1) to show that Tufts is serious and is working on Cyber Security matters, (2) to provide learning material to the public on Cyber Security as the Cyber Security education problem is very dire, (3) for recordkeeping on what is taught and not taught in this Security class --this comes up often when we speak to industry and organizations who want to work with Tufts on Cyber Security-related matters. The Canvas site for this course isn't made publicly available. Even if Canvas site was made publicly available, content is behind a walled garden, and (4) for redundancy if Canvas goes down.</p>
    <h3>Q: I have not taken a course on Networks (COMP 112), Operating Systems (COMP 111), or Computer Architecture (COMP 40) yet. Is that a problem?</h3>
    <p>No. Cyber Security is a very broad field and it is impossible for anyone, even professionals, to know everything. What is important for you is to start thinking about Security.</p>
    <h3>Q: If I am taking this course for professional purpose, can I have a tuition reimbursement letter or certificate?</h3>
    <p>A: <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmchow/status/1085649884663828481" target="_blank">Absolutely! It's a nice tuition reimbursement letter, hand signed!</a></p>
    <h3>Q: Is there an archive of a previous course website available?</h3>
    <p>A: Sure, <a href="index-summer2020.html">here is the public course website for summer 2020 semester</a>.</p>
    <h3>Q: Will this course use ProctorU?</h3>
    <p>A: <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/proctoru-confirms-data-breach-after-database-leaked-online/" target="_blank">Absolutely not!</a></p>
    <h3>Q: Will there be guest speakers?</h3>
    <p>A: You can bet at least one.</p>

    <h2 id="expectations">Expectations and Structure of This Online Course</h2>
    <p>This course will be a fun one for sure. A few notes on the expectations and structure of this course:</p>
    <h3>1. What this course will NOT have and what I will NOT do:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Require students to meet online during specific times.  This course is largely asynchronous online despite having live sessions which are recitation-style.</li>
        <li>Require students to physical meet at the Tufts Medford Campus.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. You are responsible for your own learning.</h3>
    <p>A very important point: if you want everything gone over in lecture or in notes, then this is not the course for you. More importantly, that's not how things work in real life.</p>
    <h3>3. You will learn by doing.</h3>
    <p>Each week, there will be at most three labs to hone your skills and to aim at the crux of the matter for the week. Here's an analogy: you don't learn how to cook simply by just reading cookbooks and watching YouTube videos. You learn by making, using your hands, and making mistakes.</p>
    <h3>4. You will learn by asking questions.</h3>
    <p>It is your responsibility to ask questions early and to ask for help...</p>
    <h3>5. ...and I expect discussions online to be very active and civil.</h3>
    <p>Share thoughts and respond to other people's questions. I will be online constantly.  It is no secret that I respond very quickly unless I need to be away.</p>
    <p>There is a very good post published by Northeastern University: "How To Be a Successful Online Learner."
